Next.js Estimate Management App
Overview

This is a Next.js project that interacts with a Django backend to manage estimates and their associated equipment. The frontend allows users to:

    View a list of estimates.
    Add new estimates with multiple pieces of equipment.

We are looking for improvements to the project as detailed below.

1.  Connect Backend API to Frontend

    Ensure the frontend (using index.tsx and add.tsx) is correctly connected to the Django backend API.

2. Use Environment Variables

    Introduce and utilize environment variables where appropriate, such as for API endpoints.
    Update the project to dynamically handle different environments (development, production) through .env files.

3. Evaluate Routing System

    The project currently uses the pages routing system.
    Evaluate whether to stick with the current routing structure or migrate to app/ routing for better flexibility and scalability.
    Provide reasoning and implement changes accordingly if necessary.

4. Improve Component System

    Refactor the code to make better use of components. For instance, break down common elements like headers, forms, and lists into reusable components.
    Ensure the code is organized for scalability and maintainability.

5. Eliminate Code Duplication

    Review the project for any duplicate or redundant code.
    Refactor the code to remove duplications, following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

6. Functional Improvements

    Improve the overall functionality of the project.
    Add error handling, loading states, and improve the user interaction with API calls.
    Ensure smooth navigation and a robust user experience across the app.

7. Visual and UX Enhancements

    Improve the visual design and user experience of the application.
    Add appropriate CSS styles to make the app more visually appealing and enjoyable to use.
    Use your creativity to enhance the UI, ensuring it aligns with modern design standards.

Notes

    All changes should be documented and commented for easy understanding.
    Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness where applicable.
